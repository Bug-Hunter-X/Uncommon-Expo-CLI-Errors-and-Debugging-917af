This error typically occurs when an Expo CLI command fails to execute correctly due to underlying issues with the environment, project setup, or dependencies.  The error message itself may not be very descriptive.  Debugging often requires inspecting the Expo CLI logs for more details.  Specific causes can include problems with Node.js versions, incorrect package configurations, or conflicting dependencies.
