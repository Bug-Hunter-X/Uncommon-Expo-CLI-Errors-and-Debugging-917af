Debugging these uncommon Expo CLI errors often involves the following steps:

1. **Check Expo CLI Version:** Ensure you have the latest version installed (`expo --version`). Update if necessary using `npm install -g expo-cli`.
2. **Examine Logs:** Carefully examine the complete Expo CLI output. Look for warnings or error messages that precede the main error. These often provide clues about the underlying cause.
3. **Check Node.js Version:** Expo has specific Node.js version requirements. Ensure your Node.js version is compatible. Use a version manager like nvm to switch between versions easily.
4. **Inspect Package.json:** Verify the dependencies in your `package.json` file. Ensure all packages are compatible and correctly specified. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to update or install packages.
5. **Clean and Rebuild:** In some cases, a clean build can resolve issues.  Try deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` or `yarn install` again.  Also consider deleting the `.expo` and `ios` (or `android`) folders for a more thorough clean.
6. **Check for Conflicting Dependencies:**  Use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to investigate package dependencies and identify potential conflicts. Resolving conflicts may require adjusting versions or excluding problematic packages.
7. **Simpler Project Test:** Create a minimal Expo project to determine if the error is related to the project's code or the Expo CLI itself.  This helps isolate the source of the problem.
8. **Community Forums:** Search for similar error messages on the Expo community forum or Stack Overflow.  Solutions provided by other users may offer quick resolutions.
